Step 1.) Collection of due payment data:

Most ERP systems (even legacy ones) keep records of the transactions and the data about due payments or defaulters can be easily extracted from the ERP system. 
This raw data is mostly in the form of an spreadsheet which needs to be cleaned. The data cleaning process include removing unnecessary fields of data such as 
previous order data. The data can then be converted into a NoSql database and can be fed to 
a Amazon DynamoDB database. I am planning to keep the cloud functions needed around AWS to maintain consistency and cohesiveness of the solution.

const customerData = [
  {
    customer_name: 'Customer 1',
    customer_order: 'Order 123',
    customer_payment: 100,
    customer_due_date: '2024-01-10',
    customer_email: 'customer1@example.com',
  },
  {
    customer_name: 'Customer 2',
    customer_order: 'Order 456',
    customer_payment: 150,
    customer_due_date: '2024-01-15',
    customer_email: 'customer2@example.com',
  },
  // Add more customers as needed
];
